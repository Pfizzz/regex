regex practice

\. = literal dot (NOT meta character)

Meta characters:

\d = 0-9
\w = A-Za-z0-9
\s = any white spcae, tab
. = matches any character whatsoever
\W = anything thats NOT a word character
\S = anything thats NOT a spcae
\D = anything thats not 0-9

Quantifiers:

* = 0 or more
+ = 1 or more
? = 0 or 1 (optional)
{min, max}
{n}

Position:
^ = beginning
$ = end
\b = word boundary 

Character classes:
[abc] = match an "a" OR a "b" OR a "c"
[-.] = dot becomes a literal dot (no longer meta character in a class).

PHONE NUMBER EXERCISE:
How to select different phone numbers:

201-555-6789 = \d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}
646.555.1234 = d{3}[.-]\d{3}[.-]\d{4}
(212)867-5309 = [(]\d{3}[)][.-]\d{3}[.-]\d{4}

to select all of them at once:

\(?\d{3}[-.)]\d{3}[-.]\d{4}
(the order of the -.) in the class is important)
\(? = the ( is optional.
THIS TRANSLATES TO:
"I would like to match a literal open parenthesis optionally, 
followed by three digits,
followed by a dash or a period or a closed parenthesis,
followed by tree digits,

^\w+ = the beginning of a line, followed by one or more word characters
\w+$ = word characters at the end of a line

\b\w{4}\b = beginning of a word, 4 characters, end of word (4-letter word)
\b\w{4,6}\b = match all words between 4-6 word characters
l[yi]nk = match l +y or i + nk (using character class yi)
l[yi (]nk = mat l +y or i or space or ( +nk
